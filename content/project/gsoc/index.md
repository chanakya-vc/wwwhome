title: Google Summer of Code
summary: This project leveraged the Programmable-Real Time Unit (PRU) microprocessor on the BeagleBone Black to serve as an SPI and I2C master controller, by developing Device Drivers on the ARM side and Firmware on the PRU side. The aim was to introduce additional serial interfaces without the need for extra hardware controllers or the burden of CPU-intensive bit-banging. Completed as part of Google Summer of Code with BeagleBoard.org, all code is openly available under the GPL v2 license, with required reproduction of copyright notices and conditions included in the source files. For more details on how to use the code for your application, please refer to the Wiki and watch the explanatory video.
