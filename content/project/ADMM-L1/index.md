title: ADMM Optimization based Lasso and Ridge Regression
summary:  The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is a powerful algorithm that utilizes parallelization to solve optimization problems efficiently. This project focused on deriving the ADMM algorithm for Lasso and Ridge regression and comparing its convergence performance with the standard implementation in Scikit-learn.
