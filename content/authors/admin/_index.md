I am a first year Ph.D. student at Boston University and am advised by [Dr. Vivek Goyal](https://www.vivekgoyal.org) as part of the Signal Transformation and Information Representation Group(STIR). 
My research is centered around solving Inverse Problems in Computational Imaging using Deep Learning Methods. In particular, I am working on developing algorithms that help process data from an Scanning Tunnelling Microscope to generate better and more meaningful images to aid in material analysis. 

Beyond research I really love to run and go on hikes. I also have a lot of interest in Nature Photography and have posted some of my favourite photos that I have clicked in the Gallery section.
