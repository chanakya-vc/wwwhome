I’m a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Boston University, where I work under the guidance of [Dr. Vivek Goyal](https://www.vivekgoyal.org) in the Signal Transformation and Information Representation (STIR) Group. My research is centered around developing model-based learning solutions for inverse problems in computational imaging and machine learning. Currently, I am focused on creating forward models and physics-based estimators for particle beam microscopy, particularly in the areas of material analysis and edge detection for segmentation, with applications in semiconductor device characterization and metrology.

Outside of my research, I’m passionate about running and hiking. I’m also an aspiring astronomer with a growing interest in astrophotography!
